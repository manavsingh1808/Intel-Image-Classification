# Intel-Image-Classification

## This is state of the art Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and using Adaptive Moment estimation (ADAM).

This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
{'buildings' -> 0,
'forest' -> 1,
'glacier' -> 2,
'mountain' -> 3,
'sea' -> 4,
'street' -> 5 }

The training accuracy was about 95 % with validation accuracy of 80% and final test accuracy of 80%. The model perfomed very well on the prediction data giving errors
occasionally between glaciers and sea images , it is only natural as it is tough for humans to distinguish between the two.
